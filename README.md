# Soul Intention Disco Website


## Rationale and reason for site

Site will act as a presence for my mobile soul DJ hobby
It consist of a homepage, gallery page, audio clip page, video clip page
and an enquiry page 

The written content contains an about us section, what music we play,
what equipment we use, where we play and how to make an enquiry.


It is responsive, with versions for various screen sizes. Mobile first approach
was deployed.

Balsamiq was used to wireframe to the desktop and smaller screen versions 


## What the project does

The webisite sets out to act as a presence for my mobile DJ hobby, it explains
the type of music we play and with relevant images, music and video tracks along
along with an enquiry form.

There are hyperlinks within the text directing users to other pages, clicking
the main logo on every page will take the visitor back to the homepage.

In the footer are social links (presently dummy)and a link to the enquiry page

## Languages and Frameworks Used
    HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap v3.7.1
    Hover.css Javascript CDN,
    Fontawesome 4.7.0, Google Fonts, Coolors.com 

## Testing
During development and styling many "clitches" were discovered, reviewed and corrected,
this was aided by using a snagging list (soul intention snagging list.doc)


## Development Method
Pre development wireframes were created using Balsamiq (see [wireframes.pdf](wireframes.pdf))
The site was developed in Cloud9 within an Ubuntu based workspace using a mobile 
first approach. To ensure responsiveness of the site all changes were tested 
using Responsive Design Mode in Chrome. Having commited all changes to git
on a frequent basis, the site was deployed to Github. Website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) was used to determine a colour 
scheme that uses complementary colours (see [palette.pdf](palette.pdf)).

Some elements were lifted from Bootstrap library and amemded accordingly to suit
the style and layout, such as the Navbar and Image gallery, the booking form element
was lifted from a fellow student project and tweaked to fit my needs by adjusting
the column widths.

## Notes
Booking form is a dummy only at present, by design no java script is running to facilitate this
