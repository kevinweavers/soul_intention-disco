and an enquiry page 

The written content contains
   An about us section, what music we play,what equipment we use, where we play,
   how to make an enquiry.



It is responsive, with versions for various screen sizes. Mobile first approach

Pre development wireframes were created using Balsamiq (see [wireframes.pdf](wireframes.pdf))

first approach. To ensure responsiveness of the site all changes were tested 
using Responsive Design Mode in Safari. Having commited all changes to git, the 
site was deployed to Github. Website [coolors.co](https://coolors.co) was used to determine a colour 
scheme that uses complementary colours (see [palette.pdf](palette.pdf)).
